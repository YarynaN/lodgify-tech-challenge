# This Project was bootstarpped using [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 
Dear reviewer, leaving this default section for your convenience.

In general this is a simple SPA projects, which serves the widget component based on mockups.
You can find that styles are `MUI (Material UI)` based with theme adjusted for mockup palette.
I have also added basic unit tests and UI tests for components and calculations.
As for global state management I have used `React Context`.

### `npm start`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
